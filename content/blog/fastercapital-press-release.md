## Press Release

**Kampala, Uganda & Dubai, UAE – January 18, 2026**

Kamog Artistry (U) Ltd, an innovative stationery, print press, and branding startup company based in Kikoni, Kampala – Uganda, today announced a strategic partnership with FasterCapital through its **LaunchUp Program**. This collaboration aims to accelerate Kamog Artistry’s growth by leveraging FasterCapital’s global resources and expertise to meet the rising demand for high-quality printing, branding, and artistic services in the East African market.

## Market Opportunity & Problem Statement

Located near Makerere University in Kikoni, a bustling commercial and academic hub, Kamog Artistry operates within a rapidly growing market that faces a significant gap in reliable, professional, high-quality, and affordable printing and branding services. Despite the presence of several small stationery shops, many lack the capacity to provide comprehensive solutions that address the evolving needs of students, residents, and local businesses—especially during peak academic seasons.

The printing and branding industry in Uganda continues to expand, driven by increased demand for personalized marketing materials and creative expression platforms. Kamog Artistry addresses these inefficiencies by combining integrated modern print services, professional branding solutions, and an art exhibition platform under one trusted brand.

## Startup Solution & Differentiation

Kamog Artistry’s core value proposition lies in its multifaceted approach: blending traditional print services with innovative branding and creative design solutions tailored to individuals, institutions, and small-to-medium enterprises. The company also provides a dedicated space for showcasing fine art.

Equipped with state-of-the-art machinery—including Xerox digital printers, Offset Speed Master printers, UV flatbed printers, large-format printers, sublimation printers, embroidery machines, CNC cutting machines, Epson ID printers, heat-press machines, and professional binding equipment—Kamog Artistry ensures high-quality, customizable products suited to student, business, and community needs.

Early traction includes strong community feedback and growing interest from Makerere University students and nearby enterprises. The company’s extended operating hours, personalized branding services, and commitment to fostering a creative hub further distinguish it from conventional stationery providers.
